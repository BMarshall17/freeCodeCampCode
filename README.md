# freeCodeCampCode
I am using this repository as a sort of log to keep a record of everything that I have learned and created with FreeCodeCamp. I will not be going back to rewrite projects using more advanced techniques, but will be leaving them as is to document my coding journey. The purpose of this repository is for my own personal reference and guide.
